# COVID-19 Data Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 data sourced from Our World in Data. It includes visualizations of trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations across different countries and continents, with a focus on South Africa and other major regions affected by the pandemic.

## Objectives

- Load and explore the COVID-19 dataset
- Visualize the progression of daily new cases and deaths
- Compare regional and global impacts
- Analyze vaccination progress by country
- Derive meaningful insights from the data

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files in this Repository

- `owid-covid-data.csv`: The raw dataset used for analysis.
- `covid_data_analysis_with_graphs.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook with code, visualizations, and insights.
- `README.md`: This file describing the project.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gatsheni528/covid-data-analysis.git
   cd covid-data-analysis
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook covid_data_analysis_with_graphs.ipynb
   ```

3. Run all cells to generate the visualizations and outputs.

## Key Visualizations

- Daily new COVID-19 cases in South Africa
- Comparison of new cases across top 5 affected countries
- Total deaths by continent
- Top 5 countries by total vaccinations
- South Africaâ€™s total cases vs. deaths over time
- Global trend of new cases vs. new deaths

## Insights & Reflections

- South Africa experienced multiple distinct waves of infections.
- Global trends show spikes aligning with major pandemic waves.
- Vaccination rates varied significantly by country, influencing case severity and death rates.
- Visualization helps uncover patterns not immediately obvious in raw data.
